\noindent
I am a software developer and dedicated to making cool things work. I know how to make processing of real-life data effective and stable, what algorithms to choose in each case for the best performance. I can design and implement useful and maintainable API and choose the best way to store and process data. I learned a number of programming languages on my programming journey started in 2000 including Pascal/Delphi, ABAP, Java, so I'm  language-agnostic and ready to learn a new one in time of need, although Java remains my main language for the last several years.
